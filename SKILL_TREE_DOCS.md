### Data Structure

```typescript
interface Skill {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  category: string
  level: number
  maxLevel: number
  skillPoints: number
  isUnlocked: boolean
  icon: React.ReactNode
  color: string
}

interface SkillCategory {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  icon: React.ReactNode
  color: string
  totalSkillPoints: number
  maxSkillPoints: number
  skills: Skill[]
}
```

### Integration with Quest System

1. **Quest Completion**: When a user completes a quest, they receive SP in relevant skill categories
2. **Skill Progression**: SP accumulation unlocks new skills and increases skill levels
3. **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars and achievement badges provide motivation
4. **Gamification**: RPG-style progression keeps users engaged

## Usage

### Viewing the Skill Tree

### Completing Quests
1. Click the "Complete Quest" button to see available quests
2. Select a quest to view its skill rewards
3. Complete the quest to earn SP
4. Watch your skill tree progress update

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Real-time Updates**: Live skill tree updates as quests are completed
- **Skill Prerequisites**: Some skills require others to be unlocked first
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Interactive skill tree graphs
- **Social Features**: Compare progress with other guild members
- **Custom Skills**: Allow users to add personal skill goals

### Technical Improvements
- **Backend Integration**: Connect to actual quest completion data
- **Database Storage**: Persistent skill progression data
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API for skill management
- **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket updates for live progress

## Design Philosophy

The Skill Tree system is designed to:
- **Motivate**: Clear progression paths encourage continued participation
- **Visualize**: Easy-to-understand representation of skill growth
- **Gamify**: RPG-style mechanics make learning engaging
- **Personalize**: Individual skill paths based on user interests
- **Track**: Comprehensive record of learning achievements

## Contributing

To contribute to the Skill Tree system:

1. **Add New Skills**: Extend the skill categories with new technologies
2. **Improve UI**: Enhance the visual design and user experience
3. **Add Features**: Implement new gamification elements
4. **Optimize Performance**: Improve component rendering and data management

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations
- **Icons**: Lucide React icons

## Getting Started

1. Import the `SkillTree` component
2. Add the component to your page
3. Customize skill categories and data as needed
4. Integrate with your quest completion system

```tsx
import { SkillTree } from "@/components/skill-tree"

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SkillTree />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The Skill Tree system transforms the traditional learning experience into an engaging, gamified journey that motivates users to continue developing their technical skills while providing clear visual feedback on their progress.
